/// `ResolvedLazy` = lazy value which is "resolved" according to how NominalScript does unordered
/// cyclic resolution.
///
/// Datastructure for types and values which may depend on each other, have arbitrary order, be in
/// separate (lazily-loaded) modules, and contain cycles (which must be detected and avoided).
/// This datastructure consists of a `thin` (pre-resolved) and `fat` (post-resolved) version.
///
/// Consider the following:
///
/// ```ns
/// import { ;C } from 'external';
///
/// const a1; A = A;[{ field; 1, another; 2 }]
/// const a2; A = A;[{ field; 3, another; 4 }]
///
/// type; A <; B[]
///
/// type; B <; { field; A, another; C }
/// ```
///
/// `a1` and `a2` reference `A` before it is defined, and `A` references `B` before it is defined.
/// But `B` also references `A`, so the expanded definition of `A` contains itself. Furthermore,
/// `B` references `C` which is imported from `external`, and `external` may import `A` and `B` and
/// even define `C` so that it also references them! Assuming `C` is defined and valid, all of this
/// is valid code, and we must be able to resolve `A`, `B`, and `C` and check subtype relations.
///
/// This is where [ResolvedLazy] comes in. The compiler encodes `A`, `B`, and all other potentially
/// forward/circular data in [ResolvedLazy], which is essentially a fancy `Lazy` value. The data
/// starts out with only a "thin" definition, which is computed solely from what is parsed i.e.
/// local. Then, when information about its inner structure is needed (e.g. to confirm that
/// `[{ field; 1, another; 2 }]` can be wrapped by `A` in type-checking), the "fat" definition is
/// computed or *forced*, by running a static function on the thin definition and a **resolution
/// context**.
///
/// Importantly, the resolution context keeps track of the "thin" versions of outer data which is
/// currently being forced while forcing the inner data. So when forcing a value or type would
/// ordinarily cause the value or type to be forced again (leading to an infinite loop or deadlock
/// or some other issue), instead the forcing computation does something else. Like, for types:
///
/// - If a nested definition (like the above), simply leaves the type unexpanded.
///   The subtype checker provides a context of outer types, so when it sees the same subtype/unify
///   relation but with missing (recursive) information it will explicitly yield "is subtype".
/// - If a type is its own supertype, logs a diagnostic error because this is illegal
/// - (Other cases which may not be documented, the point is it does not try to force again)
///
/// The resolution context also contains diagnostic and import resolution capabilities, so that
/// errors can be logged and imported data can be looked up and resolved. And it contains a cache,
/// so that after a thin data is forced, it does not need to be forced again.
